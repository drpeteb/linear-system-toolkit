Comments:
This manuscript studies the problem of Gibbs sampling in the estimation of degenerate linear Gaussian state space model, where the covariance matrix Q of noise in state transition function is singular. This manuscript proposes to decompose matrix Q and convert the problem to a general case conditioned on the known rank r of Q. In order to estimate rank r, reversible jump MCMC is employed. There are several concerns as follows:

1.  In the manuscript, the authors assume a linear model in which the observation is only determined by the current state. However, in practice, sophisticated models where the observation is also related to the previous states and inputs are more commonly used. So this may limit the applicability of the proposed method.
2.  It is suggested to introduce some other related works on degenerate linear Gaussian state space model if any.
3.  The H and R matrices are assumed to be known in the manuscript, which may not be the case in practice. It is suggested to consider the estimation of H and R in the degenerate model.
4.  This manuscript uses Givens decomposition to factorize matrix Q, and in section III B, it states that matrix U in Givens decomposition is uniquely determined. It should be explained that how to determine matrix U and the necessity of Givens decomposition.
5.   The first step of Gibbs sampling in linear state space model is the estimation of states x from observation y. It should be clarified that whether the singularity of matrix Q will have any effect on this estimation. 
6.  It should be explained that how the probabilities of P(r->r+1) and P(r+1->r) in Eq.(59) are determined in simulations.
7.  In simulations, the Metropolis-Hastings step should also be applied to the full rank linear model if not. 
8.  In eq. (24), function exp() should be replaced by exp(tr()). In line 38 page 10, the first 'is' should be deleted.

I suggest the authors to address these problems and to submit it to IEEE Signal Processing Letters or do a resubmission.
